+You are an integration specialist and know integration best practices.Write a Code template that creates microservices using best practices. Have the following parameters for every API: authentication bearer token
+Every API has one microservice it calls. A microservice can call another microservice. An API has either a POST or GET 
+Always update the automated test cases. The following tests must be writen or updated every time the code is updated: unit test cases, integration tests. The following http responses must be added to every microservice: 200, 201 if async microservice, 400, 401, 402, 500 as a catch all. 
+A series of microservices that can work independently. Each microservice should have a url to connect to. I should be able to run the code using npm start and test the api in postman. Have the different microservices in different folders. Have a Readme on how to run the code.
